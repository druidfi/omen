You should just focus on your project specific configuration.

```
$ composer require druidfi/omen:^1.0
```

## TODO

Add support for:

- Lando
- Drupal VM
- Other dev tools and environments

## Where the name "Omen" comes from?

Druids interpreted the waves of the ocean or read clouds for mundane or important omens. So `reading clouds` is
basically what `druidfi/omen` is doing.
